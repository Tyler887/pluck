# This YAML file is used to build pluck ISOs to create the ISO from the actual
# Debian suite. These ISOs are amd64 builds on the latest Linux kernel. These are
# "desktop" builds, servers can use "server" builds. snapd is usally installed by
# default.

# WARNING: The build is defaulted to the Debian "bookworm" distribution, but
# if you want older software, change it to the codename of the Debian release
# you want, e.g. "buster" or "bullseye".
